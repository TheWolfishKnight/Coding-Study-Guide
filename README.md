## Description

- My motivation to create this project was to learn some basics and fundamentals of HTML, Git, Javascript, and CSS by building a MVP which incorporated all four topics.
- Going on forward, I can update this website to increase functionality. 
- It will act as both an information storage for the bootcamp and a sandbox tool to try out new techniques.
-During this project, I learned fundamentals of HTML, such as how <meta> and <body> elements differ, fundamentals of css, such as how to link files and change element colors and structure, fundamentals of Git, such as the Git Workflow, and fundamentals of Javascript, such as <for> loops and arrays.

## Installation

There are no steps to install my project due to its deployment. However, it does require a working internet browser with Javascript implementation. I recommend Chrome or Firefox on Windows or just Opera on MacOs.

## Usage

Visit the website through any means. Then, open the browser console (this differs from browser to browser), however you can usually right click anywhere on the page and click on "Inspect Element".

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![Right Click](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Next make sure you are on the console tab in the new window that opens up.

![Console Tab](assets/images/Screenshot2.png)

After that, you should be able to see the console and its recommendation for study. If you want to see another recommendation, refresh the page. This can usually be done at the top of your browser or by pressing the F5 key on your keyboard
